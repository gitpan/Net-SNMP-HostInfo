Net::SNMP::HostInfo
===================

Net::SNMP::HostInfo is a class that simplifies access to the
IP, TCP, and UDP information of a MIB-II compliant network host,
such as a router or a PC.

You can use it to retrieve numerous statistics on IP, ICMP, TCP, and UDP,
as well as the IP routing table (ipRouteTable),
the IP address table (ipAddrTable),
the ARP table (ipNetToMediaTable),
the TCP connection table (tcpConnTable),
and the UDP listener table (udpTable).
